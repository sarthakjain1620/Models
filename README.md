# Models
# Implementation of Machine Learning /Deep Learning models from scratch

This repository contains implementation of ML/DL models and research papers from scratch to showcase model understandability and work. 
The models are also tested on a dummy dataset to check if the implementation is correct and is working. 

I will keep updating this repository with new and more models.
