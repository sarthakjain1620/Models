# Machine Learning Model Implementations

This repository showcases my ability to implement machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, demonstrating a strong understanding of their underlying principles and algorithms.

**Purpose:**

The primary goal of this project is to:

* Deepen my understanding of machine learning and deep learning algorithms by implementing them without relying on existing libraries.
* Develop strong software engineering skills through clean, well-documented code.
* Create a resource that can be used to verify the correctness of existing library implementations (to some extent).

**Contents:**

This repository currently includes implementations of the following models:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees

For each model, you will find:

* A Python implementation.
* (Optional: A detailed explanation of the algorithm)
* Example usage on a dummy dataset.

**Future Work:**

I am continuously expanding this repository with more models and features. Upcoming implementations include:

* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Artificial Neural Networks
* (And more...)

**Contributions:**

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
